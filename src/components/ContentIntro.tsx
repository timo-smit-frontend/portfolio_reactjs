                Hey everyone, welcome to my portfolio. I am a Front-end Developer currently working for <strong>UBO Agency</strong>. In june
                2023 I finished my bachelor <strong>Communication and Multimedia Design</strong> at the University of Applied Sciences in
                Amsterdam. During my studies I became a UX/UI designer and a Front-end Developer in one. Making me a creative developer with
                user experience and accessibility at my core.

                After my studies I started working for <strong>Capgemini Netherlands B.V.</strong> for about a year. This is where I
                strenghtened my development and consultant skills. I got to work for clients like{' '}
                <strong>United Nations World Food Programme</strong> &<strong> Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal</strong>. Learning and
                consulting alot about React, Next but also accessibility and design.

                To me, coding is like putting together a puzzle, a challenging task that's intriguing to solve. Adding creativity and aiming
                to make something that brings happiness makes the whole process special. Creating something I like and seeing how it affects
                others is really satisfying.
